        This dissertation introduces a method for 3D facial gender identification using conformal mapping. Conformal mapping is valuable in applications as it preserves the orientation and angles in local neighbor areas. There has been research on implementing conformal mapping to surface
        classification. However, there has been no research exploring the influence of conformal mapping on 3D identification problems on demographic attributes of human beings in the computer vision domain, which inspires the core framework of this project.

        The main contribution of this dissertation is introducing conformal mapping to 3D facial gender identification and analyzing the performance of this novel system. Given a 3D point cloud, we wish to map the 3D model to 2D space conformally, and then extract and select features for
        classification. This dissertation explores the performance produced by two binary classifiers, an RBF-SVM classifier, and a k-NN classifier, on data with and without geometric registration. The results of the evaluation are competitive comparing to previous methods, and also indicate that
        the 3D approach with conformal mapping in this project is robust to the poses of 3D models. The evaluation of performance in this dissertation also reflects a fluctuation due to the limitation of the dataset used in this project, which inspires further evaluation using more massive datasets
        in future work. The performance also supports the value to research in 3D computer vision problems with geometric information extracted from conformal mapping.
