        In practical applications, it is difficult to obtain high-resolution images due to the limitation of the physical properties of hardware such as imaging systems and transmission networks. It is costly to improve image resolution by improving the hardware device. Therefore, from the software
        point of view, applying the image super-resolution has more important practical significance and a wider range of application.

        In this paper, the existing results of image super-resolution method are investigated. Starting from the principle of single-image super-resolution, the advantages of applying convolutional neural network to image super-resolution are analyzed. In this paper, convolutional neural networks
        are combined with sub-pixel methods to build an image super- resolution network. The image super-resolution reconstruction network is tested under different image scaling settings. In terms of reconstructing image quality and rebuilding speed, the super-resolution network in this paper has
        reached a level comparable to or better than existing research results. Based on the realization of single-image super-resolution and reference to the idea of single-image super-resolution reconstruction, the super-resolution reconstruction of video and its real-time output is realized in
        this paper.
